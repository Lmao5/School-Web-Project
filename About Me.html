      <h2 class="smallerIitle">About Me</h2>
      <p class="normalText">I am currently a student in <span><a href="https://www.nyp.edu.sg/">Nanyang Polytechnic</a></span>&nbspas a Year 1 student in Diploma of Information Technology.<br>I plan to specialise
      in A.I(Artificial Intelligence) and continue to further my studies into university.<br>Eventually,I plan to work in a big tech firm or start up a company of my own.
       I used to be a member of the InfoComm Club in <a href ="https://regentsec.moe.edu.sg/">Regent Secondary School</a> because I was interested in the field of IT and hoping that I am exposed to it as soon as possible.</p>

      <h2 class="smallerIitle">What do I do?</h2>
      <p class="normalText">I am currently learning how to code in python and learning how to build websites using HTML,CSS,Javascript in my first Semester in year one.
      I also do school assignments such as coding my <span>first book store program</span>&nbspand&nbsp<span>coding this website which will eventually be a portfolio website.</span>
      Other than school work, I do also play games as a hobby since it was readily available for me and I find games more entertaining than watching the television. Games
    has influenced me a lot in terms of making my choice for polytechnic courses in a way that it interests me to do coding.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2 class="smallerIitle">Future Plans</h2>
        <p class="normalText">I am planning to enter a prestigious university to get a degree in Computer Science and start working in big tech firms such as Google or possibly start a
        company of my own in hopes that I will be successful as them. The future is indeed uncertain but I certainly believe that with optimism and sufficient preparation, I surely believe that
      we can suceed in life.</p>
