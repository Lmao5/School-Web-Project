      <h2 class="title is-2">About Me</h2>
      <p class="subtitle">I am currently a student in <span><a href="https://www.nyp.edu.sg/">Nanyang Polytechnic</a></span>&nbspas a Year 1 student in Diploma of Information Technology. I plan to specialise
      in A.I(Artificial Intelligence) and continue to further my studies into university. Eventually,I plan to work in a big tech firm or start up a company of my own.
       I used to be a member of the InfoComm Club in <a href ="https://regentsec.moe.edu.sg/">Regent Secondary School</a> because I was interested in the field of IT and hoping that I am exposed to it as soon as possible.</p>

        <h2 class="title is-2">What do I do?</h2>
        <p class="subtitle">I am currently learning how to code in python and learning how to build websites using HTML,CSS,Javascript in my first Semester in year one.
        I also do school assignments such as coding my <span><a href="Work.html">first book store program</a></span>&nbspand&nbsp<span><a href="Work.html">coding this website which will eventually be a portfolio website.</a></span>
        Other than school work, I do also play games as a hobby since it was readily available for me and I find games more entertaining than watching the television. Games
      has influenced me a lot in terms of making my choice for polytechnic courses in a way that it interests me to do coding.</p>

          <h2 class="title is-2">Future Plans</h2>
          <p class="subtitle">I am planning to enter a prestigious university to get a degree in Computer Science and start working in big info-tech firms such as Google or possibly start a
          company of my own in hopes that I will be successful as them. The future is indeed uncertain but I certainly believe that with optimism and sufficient preparation, I surely believe that
        we can suceed in life.</p>
