          <p class="subtitle">These games have a great impact in my life. But firstly, this
            is not a review about these games but rather an opportunity for me to describe more about myself as a person.
            These games are my most played games since they have certain aspects which I really like.</p>

              <h1 class="title">Minecraft™</h1>
              <p class="subtitle">Developed by Mojang, Minecraft is a sandbox game so pretty much there is no goal at all except that if you want to follow
                 the achievements in the game. This allows players to do whatever they want in the game, be it
            building magnificent structures or becoming the top player versus player(PvP) among your friends.Minecraft is in fact my first favourite game that I still continue to play today.
              This allows me to challenge myself to build several projects of my own and allowing me to express my creativity.</p>

            <h1 class="title">Overwatch™</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">Overwatch is a team-based multiplayer first-person shooter developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment. In
              Overwatch, there are a set of diverse heroes with unique abilities and purpose and grouped into 3 categories namely Damage, Tank and Support.
              Overwatch is my favourite first-person shooter game because of the heroes themselves. Each with unique abilities and character, I am impressed by it
            and I wanted to try each and one of them. Another reason why I love the game is because of the need to do as a team to win and ensuring that everyone,
          despite their differences, are able to work together which I believe is important in today's world.</p>

              <h1 class="title">TheoTown™</h1>
              <p class="subtitle">TheoTown is a city building game where players can build and manage a city. Its graphics are similar
              to that of a retro-style city building game. Building and managing cities are fun for me since it gives me challenges to
            do such as ensuring pollution does not go near residential areas or dealing with traffic to allow the firetrucks to travel smoothly.
          My favourite part involves thinking of creative solutions to deal the problems such as good zoning use to reduce traffic or if I am lazy, I
         would raze down buildings to build highways through it since it is the cheapest way to do.</p>
